## [Description](#table-of-contents)

This project is a simple weather dashboard that lets the user input a city and see the current weather as well as the weather conditions expected over the next 5 days.

It was created to give the user a simple and easy way to view the expected weather conditions for the next 5 days in any area they choose.

Simply open the `index.html` in your browser and input the city into the field. After which the weather conditions will populate. The city saves in local storage so you can recall it easily later on or clear the storage and start again.
